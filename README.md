# Download CSV with Semicolon

## Overview

**Download CSV with Semicolon** is a Google Sheets extension created to address a common issue: Google Sheets does not natively export CSV files using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter. Many developers and professionals working with CSV files in UTF-8 format need semicolon-separated values (CSV), especially in regions where the semicolon is the standard CSV delimiter.

This extension simplifies the process of exporting Google Sheets to CSV files using semicolons, saving you time and ensuring compatibility with your workflows.

## Features
- Export Google Sheets to CSV files with a semicolon (;) as the delimiter.
- UTF-8 encoding to ensure compatibility with most systems.
- Easy and fast download process directly from Google Sheets.
- Deleted CSV files are stored in your Google Drive trash for up to 30 days, so you can recover them if needed.

## How It Works

1. **Install the Extension**: Add the "Download CSV with Semicolon" extension to your Google Sheets.
2. **Use the Extension**: Once installed, simply click the option "Export CSV with Semicolon" in your Google Sheets. A window will open, allowing you to download the CSV file.
3. **Recover Lost Files**: If you accidentally delete the file from your local machine, it will remain in your Google Drive trash for 30 days after download, giving you ample time to recover it.

## Why This Extension?

CSV files are commonly used for data exchange, especially in development environments. However, Google Sheets doesn't offer a built-in way to export CSVs with a semicolon delimiter, which is frequently required by developers in certain regions. This extension was designed to streamline this process, ensuring that your exported files are properly formatted with semicolons and UTF-8 encoding.

## Installation

To install the extension:
1. Go to the [Google Workspace Marketplace](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace).
2. Search for "Download CSV with Semicolon".
3. Click on the extension and install it to your Google Sheets.

## How to Use

1. Open a Google Sheets document.
2. Navigate to the "Extensions" menu.
3. Click on "Download CSV with Semicolon" > "Export CSV with Semicolon".
4. A download window will appear. Save the file to your computer.

That's it! Your file will now be in CSV format with semicolons as delimiters and UTF-8 encoding.
